Probing what VM modes are available:
 (failures are non-fatal, but may miss some interesting cases)

----- [OK] [-Xint]
----- [OK] [-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1]
----- [OK] []
----- [OK] [-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions, -XX:+StressLCM, -XX:+StressGCM]
----- [OK] [-XX:-TieredCompilation]
----- [OK] [-XX:-TieredCompilation, -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions, -XX:+StressLCM, -XX:+StressGCM]

Initializing and probing the target VM:
 (all failures are non-fatal, but may affect testing accuracy)

----- [OK] Unlocking diagnostic VM options
Burning up to figure out the exact CPU count....... done!

----- [OK] Trimming down the default VM heap size to 1/4-th of max RAM
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of compiler threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of parallel GC threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of concurrent GC threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of G1 concurrent refinement GC threads
----- [OK] Testing @Contended works on all results and infra objects
----- [OK] Unlocking Whitebox API for online de-optimization
----- [OK] Testing allocation profiling
----- [OK] Trying Thread.onSpinWait

  Hardware threads in use/available: 4/4, using Thread.onSpinWait()
  Test preset mode: "quick"
  Writing the test results to "jcstress-results-2018-07-08-13-22-28.bin.gz"
  Parsing results to "results/"
  Running each test matching ".*" for 1 forks, 5 iterations, 200 ms each
  Each JVM would execute at most 20 tests in the row.
  Solo stride size will be autobalanced within [10, 10000] elements, but taking no more than 100 Mb.
